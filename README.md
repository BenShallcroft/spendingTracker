# spendingTracker
Spending tracker with a bunch of different technologies to see if I can make them work.


Backend and frontend of a spending tracker.
SQL database to store things locally that is created when program is first run.
Java frontend to allow manipulation of the SQL database.
Possibly local area network connection to a phone with a version of the spending tracker so can input things using phone.
Possibly use a camera with image recognition to add the price, name of shop, name of items etc.

Java swing or AWT for building the frontend.
SQL database.
